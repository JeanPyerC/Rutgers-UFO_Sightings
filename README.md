# Rutgers - UFO Sightings


## Purpose of this project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of this project is to understand how Javascripts works. With Javascripts, we are able to create our own website with certain rules. We are able to create different rules, and have them all connect so they can function as one. 

## Results:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The request from the client was to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client wanted the ability to filter by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website. Overall, the project came out perfect. You are able to filter the data you are looking for, and have it show in front of you. 

## Summary:

### Drawback:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. Some shapes like "light" might not be as intuitive. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as "elcajon", “el cajon_”, or "El Cajon". The only acceptable input would be "el cajon".

### Recommendations:
1. In the next update, we shouldn't make it case sensitvie or we can include a drop down list for easier access. 


3. We should create a filter column by month or year. It will very usefull to filter by month and year, to see how many time a certain location came up for this year.
